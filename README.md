# Real_estate_prices_prediction_R

This is the final project for my Regression class at Ecole Polytechnique (MSc Data Science, 2019-2020).
I worked with a classmate ([Tommy Tran](https://github.com/TommyTranX)) to predict house prices using regression techniques in R.

* We first pre-processed a raw dataset containing information about sale prices, location, house characteristics...
* Then we went through exploratory data analysis to understand our dataset and check how variables behave (compared to sale price and to each other).
* We finally built and evaluated regression models using R.

You will find in this repository our final report and working files.
